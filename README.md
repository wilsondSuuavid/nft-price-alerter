# NFT Price Tracker Alert Bot

## Overview

The **NFT Price Tracker Alert Bot** is a Python-based tool that tracks the price of specific NFTs from a collection on OpenSea. It monitors prices against a defined threshold and sends an alert email if a token’s price falls below the threshold. This is ideal for users looking to receive notifications about potential deals.

### Features

- **Real-Time Price Monitoring**: Regularly checks NFT prices on OpenSea.
- **Threshold-Based Alerts**: Only sends an alert if the price falls below a specified ETH threshold.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends alerts to a specified email address.

### Prerequisites

To use this script, you’ll need:

1. Python 3.x
2. Required libraries: `requests`, `smtplib` (built-in), and `email` (built-in)

Install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Usage

#### Step 1: Update the Contract Address, Token IDs, and Threshold

Replace the `contract_address` and `token_ids` with the specific NFT collection’s contract address and token IDs you wish to track. Set the `price_threshold` to the ETH value you’d like to use as the alert threshold.

#### Step 2: Configure Email Alerts

In `email_config`, add:

- **from_email**: Email address from which alerts are sent.
- **to_email**: Recipient’s email address.
- **smtp_server** and **smtp_port**: Email provider’s SMTP server and port (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com` for Gmail).
- **password**: Password for the `from_email` account.

Ensure that **two-factor authentication** is disabled or set up an **app-specific password** if using Gmail or another secure email provider.

#### Step 3: Run the Script

Run the script using:

```bash
py nft_price_tracker_alert_bot.py
```

The script will check each token’s price periodically (default: every 10 minutes) and send an alert email if a price is below the threshold.

### Example

If your contract address is `0x12345...` and you wish to track tokens `[1, 2, 3]` with an alert threshold of `0.5` ETH:

```python
contract_address = "0x12345..."
token_ids = [1, 2, 3]
price_threshold = 0.5
```

Then run:

```bash
py nft_price_tracker_alert_bot.py
```

### Important Notes

- **API Rate Limiting**: OpenSea enforces rate limits on their API. Ensure you don’t check too frequently to avoid being blocked.
- **Email Security**: Use a secure email account and follow email provider recommendations for app-specific passwords or two-factor authentication.

### Limitations

- **Platform-Specific**: This script is tailored for OpenSea. Adjustments may be needed to track prices on other platforms.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: This script fetches data periodically; it may miss price changes that occur between intervals.

### Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Add SMS or Telegram notifications as alternative alert channels.
- **Enhanced Scheduling**: Use a scheduler (e.g., cron) to manage start/stop intervals.
- **Database Logging**: Log price data in a database for historical tracking and analysis.
